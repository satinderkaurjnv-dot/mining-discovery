 *   #9E7208  --color-gold-hover, the darkest gold on the site. Carries the top.
 *   #B8860B  --color-gold. The rich body.
 *   #D4AF37  --color-gold-muted. The vivid band.
 *   #FAF5E8  --color-gold-light. Where it softens.
 *   #FBFBFA  Stats' own section background, verbatim from Stats.tsx.
 * Hue barely moves across those four (42deg to 46deg) — what changes is saturation and
 * lightness, which is what reads as depth rather than as a second colour.
 *
 * The stop POSITIONS are not arbitrary, and this is the part worth keeping straight. The
 * element is 130vh, bottom-anchored in a 100vh card, so its top 23.1% is clipped and the
 * card shows 23.1% to 100%. Screen position maps as `element% = 23.1 + p * 76.9`:
 *   24%  -> the very top of the screen        -> darkest (#9E7208)
 *   58%  -> 45% down the screen               -> most saturated (#D4AF37, opaque)
 *   74%  -> 66% down                          -> softening to cream
 *   90%  -> 87% down                          -> Stats' colour, and flat from there
 * Placed by screen position instead of by element position, the richest band lands mid
 * view rather than off the top edge, which is what a flat-looking version gets wrong.
 *
 * The flat #FBFBFA run at the foot is deliberate and load-bearing: the panel's bottom
 * edge and the card's bottom edge coincide, and Stats begins on the next pixel, so that
 * run is what makes the handoff seamless. Everything above 58% is translucent, so the
 * planet still reads through the rich part instead of being covered by it.
