/*
 * TRUSTED BRANDS — the brand wall.
 *
 * An asymmetric wall rather than a grid: twelve marks placed on a 12-column field at three
 * different sizes, so the eye moves through them instead of scanning a table. The full
 * roster then runs past once in a slow marquee, which is what says "and twenty-seven more"
 * without a number attached to it.
 *
 * ASSETS ARE THE PROJECT'S OWN. Every logo comes from src/data/trustedBrands.ts — the same
 * verified roster the homepage grid and /about's marquee use. Nothing here invents a client,
 * and no brand appears that is not already in that file.
 *
 * NO "FEATURED" LABEL. Three marks are set larger for editorial rhythm, which is a
 * typographic decision. Calling them featured would be a claim about a commercial
 * relationship the project holds no information about, so the hierarchy is size only.
 *
 * PLAIN <img>, NOT next/image, and deliberately — the same call TrustedBy.tsx and
 * AboutTrustedBrands.tsx already made and documented. These files are hotlinked from
 * miningdiscovery.com: next/image would need that host in images.remotePatterns (a global
 * config change) and would proxy 27 files through the optimiser on a host we do not control.
 * A bare <img> also fires onError, which is the signal the wordmark fallback needs.

 * sizing by width alone turns each cell into a tall square that is mostly white margin — the
 * mark ends up tiny and the wall reads as sparse. Capping the cell height and clipping
