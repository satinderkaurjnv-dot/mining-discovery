     * lerp rather than duration + easing, and that swap is the whole change.
     *
     * With `duration`, every wheel event starts a NEW 1.2s tween from wherever the last
     * one had reached. The old easing (expo-out) spends most of its distance in its first
     * fraction, so a burst of events — which is what one continuous scroll gesture
     * actually is — kept re-triggering that fast opening section. The result is a
     * velocity that surges and eases repeatedly instead of holding steady, and that is
     * what reads as choppy while scrolling rather than while stopping.
     *
     * `lerp` is a continuous exponential approach to the target instead of a restarting
     * tween: continuous input gives continuous velocity, and Lenis normalises it for
     * frame rate, so a 120Hz display and a 60Hz one settle at the same speed rather than
     * the faster one arriving twice as quickly.
     *
     * 0.085 is a little below Lenis's 0.1 default — slightly longer glide, still short of
     * the float the 1.2s tween had. Lower is smoother and heavier; raise it toward 0.12
     * to track the wheel more tightly.
