    "Mining Discovery was founded in 2022 by Gaurav Sharma and Sagar Bakshi to bring clarity and depth to a mining sector often clouded by noise — covering exploration, production, regulation, investment, and ESG across global mining markets.",

/*
 * The standalone About page, reached from the header's ABOUT link and the homepage CTA.
 *
 * EVERY FACT ON THIS PAGE COMES FROM miningdiscovery.com/about-us. The founding year, both
 * founders, the advisor and her fifty-plus years, the four purposes, the five principles,
 * the five differentiators, the three expansion regions, and the trusted brands roster are
 * all the source's. Nothing here should be edited into a claim the source does not make —
 * no client counts, no revenue, no office locations, no dates between 2022 and now.
 *
 * A server component. It owns the metadata and the section order and nothing else; each
 * section carries its own "use client" boundary because each drives its own GSAP timeline.
 * No <Header /> or <Footer />: the root layout (src/app/layout.tsx) already wraps every
 * page in both. The hero's pt-32 is the offset for that layout's fixed header, which
 * overlays the page rather than sitting in the flow.
 *
 * Vertical scroll throughout, on purpose. The homepage's About section is a four-panel
 * horizontal pin; repeating that mechanic here would make the two read as the same
 * component twice rather than as a summary and its full account. Shared vocabulary instead
 * of shared motion — gold hairline, eyebrow, serif headline, masked word reveal.
 */
/*
 * THE PAGE GROUND: #F7F5EF, warm ivory, declared on the wrapper below and nowhere else —
 * no global CSS, no body/html/:root, nothing any other route can reach.
 *
 * For it to be visible at all, the sections that used to paint #FBFBFA over it had to stop
 * painting. That near-white was never an intentional contrast; it was simply this page's
 * alternate tint, and the wrapper now holds that role. Sections that declare a colour of
 * their own keep it — white on Origin, Advisor, Principles and Trusted Brands, navy on
 * Looking Ahead — so the page still alternates ground to ground rather than flattening into
 * one ivory field.
