/*
 * OUR EXPERTISE — the editorial card showcase.
 *
 * Five service groups arriving one at a time as printed panels: each slides in from its own
 * direction, turns to show its reverse, then settles back into a stack as the next one lands
 * on top of it. At the end the whole stack leaves and the section states its conclusion.
 *
 * WHY NAVY. The page alternates ivory and white all the way down, and cards on either of
 * those read as boxes drawn on a page. On navy they read as pages — which is the whole
 * conceit — and navy is already this site's second surface (the homepage hero, the footer,
 * /about's Looking Ahead). Gold moves to #D4AF37 here, the same swap those sections make,
 * because #B8860B goes muddy on a dark ground.
 *
 * PINNING. A tall container with a `position: sticky` stage, as in ServicesProcess and the
 * homepage's scroll story — not ScrollTrigger's `pin`, which injects a spacer, rewrites the
 * section height and has to be re-measured on resize.
 *
 * TWO OVERFLOW RULES, BOTH LOAD-BEARING:
 *  - the SECTION uses overflow-x-clip, never overflow-hidden. `hidden` computes overflow-y
 *    to `auto`, which makes the element a scroll container and stops a sticky descendant
 *    pinning to the viewport. `clip` clips just as well without creating one. (src/app/
 *    page.tsx carries the same note for the same reason.)
 *  - the STICKY element itself uses overflow-hidden, which is safe — it is not its own
 *    ancestor — and it is what keeps the cards flying in and out clipped to the viewport
 *    rather than bleeding over the sections above and below.
 *
 * CONTENT RULE: the five groups, their faces and their service lines are the brief's. No
 * clients, no numbers, no claims.
