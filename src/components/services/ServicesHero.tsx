/*
 * The /services hero.
 *
 * Same design language as /about — ivory ground, gold hairline, eyebrow, masked word
 * reveal, scrubbed parallax — but a different composition on purpose. /about opens
 * left-aligned in a serif register, reading like the first page of a document. This one is
 * centred, uppercase and set in Geist Black: a statement rather than an opening paragraph.
 * That is the whole differentiation, and it is enough — nothing here needs a colour, a
 * font, or a spacing rule the site does not already own.
 *
 * It has nothing in common with the homepage's ServicesScrollStory beyond the word
 * "services", which is deliberate: that section is a pinned four-stage scroll story and
 * this is a standalone route. Neither imports the other, so neither can break the other.
 *
 * The motion primitives come from the /about module rather than a second copy. They are
 * page-neutral in behaviour — only the name says "about" — and the alternative was either
 * duplicating them or renaming ten About components that this task was told to leave
 * alone. Worth promoting to a shared name when a third page wants them.
 */

/*
 * The headline as three authored lines, so the break after "mining" and after "companies"
 * is a decision rather than an accident of the current viewport width. Each line still
 * wraps on its own when the screen is too narrow to hold it — on a phone this reads as
 * five lines, and the reveal follows whatever the browser actually did (see the timeline
 * below), not what it did at 1440.
 *
 * Sentence case in the markup with `uppercase` in CSS, not caps in the string: the caps are
 * a typographic treatment, and some screen readers spell out an all-caps word letter by
 * letter when it is caps in the DOM.
